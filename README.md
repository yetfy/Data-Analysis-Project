Data Analysis

**Datasets** - The Datasets used are public records.
The Electoral Commission published the results of the EU referendum by district and region after the vote. The Office of National Statistics provided the population demographics by district from the 2011 United Kingdom Census

**Summary Analysis**

-The Leavers won the referendeum by 52.99% (total of 17.4m votes) over the remainers who had 47.01% (16.1m votes) with voter turnout of about 74%

-A total of 263 Areas voted to leave the EU as against 119 Areas that voted to remain

-Remainers won all of Scotland and Northern Ireland Regions

-I did not observe a correlation between Age demographics and Turnout based on the dataset i was provided with

**Limitations**
- Northern Ireland results record is not broken down by city and has only one line. Had to source further data from BBC referendum results analysis in order to create a proper filled map in Tableau
- 
- The data provided was not sufficient to be able to verify turnout and voting preferences by age
