Data Analysis

**Datasets** - The Datasets used are public records.
The Electoral Commission published the results of the EU referendum by district and region after the vote. The Office of National Statistics provided the population demographics by district from the 2011 United Kingdom Census

**Limitations**
- Northern Ireland results record is not broken down by city and has only one line. Had to source further data from BBC referendum results analysis in order to create a proper filled map in Tableau
- The data provided was not sufficient to be able to verify turnout and voting preferences by age
